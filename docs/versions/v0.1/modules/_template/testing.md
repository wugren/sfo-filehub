# [Module Name] Testing

Risk profile: ./risk-profile.yaml

> This optional file records post-implementation test design. Generate test cases from `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and the delivered code, then keep this file aligned with the actual test implementation.

## Test Document Index
| Document | Topic | Scope |
|----------|-------|-------|
| none | no split testing docs yet | full module |

<!-- Keep testing artifacts in this task packet. If a task spans multiple project-level modules, use the globals task packet. Do not put a new task's testing docs under an older task's testing/<task-seq>-<task-slug>/ directory. Keep each human-authored testing doc under 1000 lines; split oversized docs and update this index. -->

## Unified Test Entry
- Machine-readable task plan: `docs/versions/<version>/modules/<module>/<task-name>/testplan.yaml`
- Task all: `UV_CACHE_DIR=.harness/uv-cache uv run --active python ./harness/scripts/test-run.py <module>/<task-name> all`
- Single-task boundary: do not run package/module scopes, `all all`, root shortcuts, or quality gates
- Registration: every generated or changed automated test is reachable through the unified entrypoint.

## Submodule Tests
| Submodule | Responsibility | Detailed Test Doc | Required Behaviors | Edge/Failure Cases | Test Type | Test Files | Status | Gap / Manual Reason |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| | | | | | | | ready / gap / manual / disabled | |

## Module-Level Tests

## Design Element Coverage
<!-- Derive cases mechanically from design artifacts per `harness/rules/test-design-rules.md`. Every element_type row is required; use `not-applicable` only with a concrete reason naming the design evidence. -->

| parameter-domain | design `## File-Level Interfaces` section / doc path | case ids or test names | unit / dv / integration | covered / gap / manual / disabled / not-applicable | reason if not covered |
| state-transition | design `## State and Ownership` state transitions | case ids or test names | unit / dv / integration | covered / gap / manual / disabled / not-applicable | reason if not covered |

## Validation Rationale
| Behavior or Risk | Validation Signal | Why This Is Sufficient | Gap / Manual Reason |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| | | | |

## Unit Tests
<!-- Function/branch granularity per `harness/rules/test-design-rules.md`: every conditional branch of changed code is executed by a case or has a per-branch gap reason. -->
| Function or Unit | Branch or Condition | Covered Behavior | Test File | Status | Gap / Manual Reason |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| | | | | covered / gap / manual / disabled / not-applicable | |

## DV Tests
<!-- Single-module runnable verification: module lifecycle, each main workflow, at least one failure workflow, behavior-changing config variants, and persisted-state recovery when applicable. -->
| Workflow | Kind | Entry | Expected Result | Test File or Script | Status | Gap / Manual Reason |
|----------|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|---------------------|
| | lifecycle / main / failure / config / persistence | | | | covered / gap / manual / disabled / not-applicable | |

## Integration Tests
<!-- Neighbor-module contracts: every consumed exported interface has a success case and a failure-semantics case (error propagation, timeout, retry, partial completion). -->
| Contract or Flow | Modules Involved | Success Case | Failure Case | Test File | Status | Gap / Manual Reason |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|

## Regression Focus
<!-- Historical bugs and high-risk boundary cases -->

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Testing docs cover all direct submodules or explain why they do not exist
- [ ] Large-module testing docs are split into direct submodule packets when proposal/design uses direct submodules
- [ ] Human-authored testing docs stay under 1000 lines, or oversized docs are split and indexed
- [ ] `testplan.yaml` matches the declared test entrypoints
- [ ] `testplan.yaml` exists for completed testing work, unless a repo-local versioned exception explicitly permits missing machine-readable test metadata and records reason, owner, risk, and acceptance impact
- [ ] Generated tests are registered with `harness/scripts/test-run.py`
- [ ] New unit tests live in dedicated test files, test directories, or test-only crates/packages; no new inline test bodies were added to production source files
- [ ] `UV_CACHE_DIR=.harness/uv-cache uv run --active python ./harness/scripts/test-run.py <module>/<task-name> all` reaches only this task's plan
- [ ] This task did not directly select package/module runtime suites, `all all`, root shortcuts, or quality gates; any broad compile-only command was a required task-local consumer-closure step
- [ ] Breaking/migration-required APIs and crate-root/build-surface changes include the required task-local contract checks and a complete repository consumer closure
- [ ] Module-level tests cover key boundary behavior and failure paths
- [ ] External interfaces have contract-focused tests
- [ ] Unit tests execute every conditional branch of changed code, or each uncovered branch has a per-branch gap reason
- [ ] DV tests cover module lifecycle, each main workflow, and at least one failure workflow, or record gaps
- [ ] Integration tests cover success and failure semantics for every consumed exported interface, or record gaps
- [ ] Every `## Design Element Coverage` element type maps to derived cases or carries a concrete not-applicable reason naming the design evidence
- [ ] Each behavior is verified at the lowest test level that can expose its failure (`harness/rules/test-design-rules.md`)
- [ ] Every implemented change has direct validation coverage or an explicit gap
- [ ] Every implemented `change_id` appears in `proposal.md`, `design.md`, generated test evidence, and the required `testplan.yaml`; a missing plan is allowed only by a repo-local versioned exception, while `manual` or `disabled` levels stay in the plan with concrete reasons
- [ ] Every validation path maps to a concrete behavior, risk, or success criterion
- [ ] Any `manual` or `disabled` layer has the same reason in `testing.md` and `testplan.yaml`
- [ ] Relevant automated tests pass
